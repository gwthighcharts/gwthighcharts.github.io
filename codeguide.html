#Work In Progress


###Targeted audience

People willing to contribute or modify the generator. 

In the following I will detail how the generator code works with the different steps of the algorithm. I will also explain some tricks I use at some point.

#Step 1 : Getting the option file

There are 2 modes available, an offline mode and an online mode. 

If set to online mode, the generator will fetch the highcharts json option file through the internet at the location specified inside the properties file. 

In offline mode we use a local file.

Once fetched, the filed is read and every option is parsed into a JSONObject. Now we can start build our tree.



#Setp 2 : Creating the tree

We need to create a tree that represents the hierarchy of options in highcharts. Once we will have this tree we will be able to go throught it and generate the corresponding java classes. We want to go from a dynamically typed language (JavaScript) to a statically typed language (Java). This has some implications in the way we have to go through the tree. 

#Step 3 : Navigating the tree and writting the classes
